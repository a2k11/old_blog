###SQL and Final Project Status 9/29/14

*I have a case of the Mondays.*  I'm not feeling too well, and I believe I
caught something from NYC's various subway systems.  It also means I will be
trying to get more rest for the next couple days.  I just learned some basic
Query language code which is not too complicated.  The biggest task will be to
use SQL effectively and without trouble later on.  I have a little bit of work
to do with my final project and I'm not too sure I will be able to follow
through with my proposal.  It is hard to plan this far ahead considering we are
only through week 1.  Hopefully I will be able to figure out more within the
next few days.  Here are some SQL functions I have learned:

1. SELECT * FROM (table) WHERE
  * ORDER BY
  * LIKE and ILIKE
  * OR, AND
  * IS NULL
2. ...FROM (table) JOIN (another table) ON (primary = foreign keys)
  * GROUP BY (label)
3. INSERT INTO
4. UPDATE 
5. DELETE
