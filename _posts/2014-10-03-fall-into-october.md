### Week 2 Learning

*I have made it through another week.*  [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) is a DSL, domain specific
language, for creating web applications in Ruby.  It uses routes which are HTTP
methods paired with a URL matching pattern.  Each route has a block and I have
created many routes throughout the week.  It's very interesting and fun to build an
application and be able to view your work on a local server.  I find it
rewarding to finish a project in class at the end of the day.  It makes me focus
more during class and it helps me greatly later on.

### I should log, about this blog, go for a jog, escape the fog

I really, really, really, hope to figure out this blog setup and I might start
building it from scratch.  I can't figure out how to link pages to the older and
newer tags at the bottom of the page and it's frustrating.  I also recently
joined a gym so I can start jogging and work my way up to running again.  I miss
doing cardio and I think it would relieve a lot of stress.  It definitely has
been a tough week but I figure if I made it this far I can go farther for sure.
