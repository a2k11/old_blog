### Rockstar Potential Interview - with Brandon Atkinson
 
On Tuesday October 21, 2014, I attended a presentation which I would 
describe as incredibly wise and thought provoking.  [Brandon
Atkinson](http://blog.appnexus.com/author/batkinson/) from 
[Global Services AppNexus](http://www.appnexus.com/globalservices/) delivered 
an amazing talk titled  <strong>Rock Star Potential Interview Training.
</strong>  I was curious but  wondered if this event would be worth my time.
I'm not an interviewer and I'm going to be the *victim* of being interviewed in
the next few months.  I have the difficult challenge of keeping my head held 
high while I persevere through interviews.  I was very close to going back to 
my [Krash](https://krash.io) pad and working on my portfolio.  But I'm glad I 
attended Brandon's presentation and here is why.

<p>
Brandon Atkinson shared his experiences and knowledge about 
interviewing throughout the entire night.  He explained to us how he 
enjoyed taking nothing but potential and turning it into something powerful.
To hear a person who has hired well over a thousand people to say such
a statement is incredible. During his presentation, I listened closely to someone who wanted to hire people for the right reasons.  Brandon loves building.  
His hiring process seems intense but it makes sense to me.  He seeks to
find the greatest qualities in people which he describes as analytical 
horsepower and Rock Star Potential.  It doesn't matter what role you are 
applying for because these two qualities will take you farther than you can
imagine.  Brandon is this type of person who can imagine that place and create a
stepping stone for your career.  Asking about specific technical skills and values come later in his interview process.  They are important but not
as much as this concept of potential.
</p>
<p>
Brandon explained to us how interviewers are the guardians of alchemy.  They
are in charge of mixing together the right employees to create something
magical.  Bringing together the right employees with high potential seems
like an easy agenda item to accomplish in a business. I would have told you
before Brandon's speech that I thought hiring was easy too.  But the more I
listened, the more I started to understand how difficult it can be for the
interviewer.  I still believe interviewing for a company is just as
difficult.  Yet, I never had an interviewer ask me the types of questions
Brandon wanted to ask.  He explained how skills can be learned but intrinsic
motivation was difficult to change.  He also mentioned past behavior was a
good indicator of future behavior.  Brandon has learned how to ask the right
questions that make him understand who you are.  I would describe him as a human lie detector but its more than just finding the truth.  He is just really trying to discover genuine, authentic, and passionate candidates.

<p>
One of the best example questions I heard from the night was "Can you tell me 
about a time when your emotions got the best of you?"  When Brandon feels the 
answer was too premeditated and too rehearsed, he asks for another example 
in order to catch you in an awkward, uncomfortable place.  There is a 
reason for all his methods and it has to deal with understanding people.  
Brandon wants to know your DNA and the force which drives your motivation.  He 
wants to know if we can learn from our mistakes, are passionate about learning, and if we have deep commitments which we strive to finish.  Brandon explained 
how some of these people you never would have hired on paper which is amazing.
I was inspired to hear such energy and commitment to this idea of having Rock Star Potential.

<p>
Now I have been talking about <strong>Rock Star Potential</strong> throughout my
blog for a reason.  If I had to sum it up in a few words, I'd like to think of it as our internal drive to overcome adversity, to never give up, to aim high, and to not be afraid to take on challenges.  It is the type of person who wants to
continually learn.  Brandon's last lesson was his approach for getting to 
know someone you are interviewing called <strong>Squeeze the Tomato.</strong>  
He wants to get underneath the surface of people he interviews so he writes
down notes during the whole process.  Odd word choice, apparent rises in 
anxiety levels, or just an unclear comment, and when he finds a soft spot on 
that tomato he sticks his finger in it!  I have to admit that makes me nervous 
for the next time I'm being interviewed.  I asked Brandon for some advice for 
the people about to be interviewed at the end of his speech.  He replied 
with being prepared, researching company you are applying to, being authentic, 
and to ask for the transparency technique at the end.  I enjoyed attending this event and even though I'm not an interviewer, I learned they have a challenging job as well.  This will definitely help me become more prepared and relaxed during the interview process.
