### First Post 9/26/14

*I'm a part of this now.*  My first week at the Ruby on Rails
[Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com) has been very cool so far.  I have met a lot
of new friends and have learned a lot about the programming language Ruby.  Here
is a list of what specifically I'm working on with Ruby:

1. Passing Blocks to Methods
  * def method(variable, &block)
  * block.call
  * yield
2. Symbols --> :symbol
3. Vim commands and becoming better at using it!
4. My typing skills
5. the methods .times, .each, and .map
6. Arrays and Hashes


### Other Thoughts / Reflection

So it has been a week now and I'm a little tired.  I definitely feel great about
the progress I've made since Monday but I don't want to become content with just
being ok.  I'm literally counting the nights until I move into the
[Krash](https://krash.io/) place I reserved through December.  Being only two
blocks away from class will be awesome and I will probably sleep better at
night.  I also will get to cook my meals again which is something I miss doing
since it helps me eat healthy foods.  My passion project at the end of this
course is still in the works.  I submitted my outline and I hope to have
feedback sooner than later.  I hope I get a chance to view some of the sites
while I'm here in New York this weekend.  

Cheers!
