###Presentation @ [WeWork](https://www.wework.com) on October 28, 2014, 6:00-7:00PM

What do you want to do with your life?  It's a question we all ask ourselves.
It's not an easy one to answer as we go through challenges in our career paths.
We make choices and we don't know what they'll mean down the road.  When it is
time to search for jobs our path doesn't become easier.  We keep asking
questions thinking about our skills, potential, and value to help a
company.  Do I have enough experience?  Do I stand out?  Can I provide something for
this company?  Elliott Bell and Erin Greenawald from [The Muse](https://www.themuse.com) 
delivered an eye opening presentation about finding the jobs you love.  As we 
enter the gauntlet of interviews and job searching,
**The Muse** helps us with the tools we need to succeed and to find jobs which
inspire us.  Elliott explained how a company is neither good or bad, but right or
wrong for a person.  In order to accomplish your goal of acquiring that slice of paradise ( .. a
job .. ), **The Muse** can offer exactly what you need.  Getting advice and gaining
knowledge from this fascinating website are a few of its many enticing features.  Erin and Elliott
presented four steps on how to not be basic when you job search:

1. Find the right people to work with.
    * People always think they want to work for Google because it's the popular,
'sexy' company.  This is not going to lead you to a career that makes you happy.
A company's culture defines their values and personality.  Finding the people
you fit in with and who can also make you happy are a priority in job hunting.  

- Talk to people at your favorite companies.
  - Learning how to have an informational interview is a great way to subtly sell
yourself.  The ability to go out, meet people, and talk to them is a huge
advantage.  Elliott described this as being your best friend.  Another key
psychological trigger is asking for help because people like to help if they
can.  Complimenting can lead to increased confidence which may inspire your
*mentor* to help more.  If you start having a conversation then the
other person will begin to ask questions.  Don't ask if they are hiring. Make
the conversation about them because people love talking about themselves.
Creating a connection is very important.  There's nothing wrong with
specifically reaching out and being persistent unless they tell you no.

- Get your application to the point.
  - The K.I.S.S. method (Keep It Simple, Stupid) defines how you want to keep your
application and resume to the point.  You want to have some creative, fun cover
letter to separate yourself from other applicants.  This also lets the company
know you researched and want to be a part of their culture.  And above all else,
make no spelling errors!  Always stay professional but convey how you understand
the company culture.  Explain why you love the company and why you would be a
great fit.

- Nail the interview.
  - Nail the little things.  It is important to stay genuine and honest while
telling your story.  But tell a great story!  It's your time to shine.  Note any
existing projects you have worked on and suggest how that experience could help
the company.  Know your value because you deserve it.  Researching a company or
other facts is acceptable and encouraged because you now have the ability to
back up your words.  Nothing is ever off the table.  The company wants to be
happy with their hire and they want their new employee to be happy too.  You
have more power than you realize.  Finally, don't ask lame questions.  Elliott
and Erin gave us some great examples to questions we should ask:

    + Could I sit with customer service for a day to better understand the production?
    + What would you like to see from me in the first 30, 60, 90 days that would make you think you made the right choice?
    + Can you show me an example of a project you recently completed that you're really proud of?

In closing, **The Muse** is a great way to hit the ground running when searching for
jobs.  They offer a lot of useful information to help market yourself and build
your skills for interviews.  I just joined today and I look forward to absorbing
all its power.
