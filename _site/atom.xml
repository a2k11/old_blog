   <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Rockstar Potential Interview - with Brandon Atkinson&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday October 21, 2014, I attended a presentation which I would
describe as incredibly wise and thought provoking.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.appnexus.com/author/batkinson/&quot;&gt;Brandon
Atkinson&lt;/a&gt; from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appnexus.com/globalservices/&quot;&gt;Global Services AppNexus&lt;/a&gt; delivered
an amazing presentation titled  &lt;strong&gt;Rock Star Potential Interview Training.
&lt;/strong&gt;  I was curious but also wondered would this be worth my time since
I&#39;m not an interviewer and I&#39;m going to be the &lt;em&gt;victim&lt;/em&gt; of being interviewed in the next few months.  I have the difficult challenge of keeping my head held high while I persevere through interviews.  The fear of being rejected and unacceptable for a company is a tough time for anyone going through this process.  I was very close to going back to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://krash.io&quot;&gt;Krash&lt;/a&gt; pad and working on my portfolio.  But I&#39;m glad I attended Brandon&#39;s presentation and here is why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Brandon Atkinson shared his experiences and knowledge about 
interviewing throughout the entire night.  He explained to us how he 
enjoyed taking nothing but potential and turning it into something powerful.
To hear a person who has hired well over a thousand people to say such
a statement is incredible. During his presentation, I listened closely to someone who wanted to hire people for the right reasons.  Brandon loves building.  
His hiring process seems intense but it makes sense to me.  He seeks to
find the greatest qualities in people which he describes as analytical 
horsepower and Rock Star Potential.  It doesn&#39;t matter what role you are 
applying for because these two qualities will take you farther than you can
imagine.  Brandon is this type of person who can imagine that place and create a
stepping stone for your career.  Asking about specific technical skills and values come later in his interview process.  They are important but not
as much as this concept of potential.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Brandon explained to us how interviewers are the guardians of alchemy.  They
are in charge of mixing together the right employees to create something
magical.  Bringing together the right employees with high potential seems
like an easy agenda item to accomplish in a business. I would have told you
before Brandon&#39;s speech that I thought hiring was easy too.  But the more I
listened, the more I started to understand how difficult it can be for the
interviewer.  I still believe interviewing for a company is just as
difficult.  Yet, I never had an interviewer ask me the types of questions
Brandon wanted to ask.  He explained how skills can be learned but intrinsic
motivation was difficult to change.  He also mentioned past behavior was a
good indicator of future behavior.  Brandon has learned how to ask the right
questions that make him understand who you are.  I would describe him as a human lie detector but its more than just finding the truth.  He is just really trying to discover genuine, authentic, and passionate candidates.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
One of the best example questions I heard from the night was &quot;Can you tell me 
about a time when your emotions got the best of you?&quot;  When Brandon feels the 
answer was too premeditated and too rehearsed, he asks for another example 
in order to catch you in an awkward, uncomfortable place.  There is a 
reason for all his methods and it has to deal with understanding people.  
Brandon wants to know your DNA and the force which drives your motivation.  He 
wants to know if we can learn from our mistakes, are passionate about learning, and if we have deep commitments which we strive to finish.  Brandon explained 
how some of these people you never would have hired on paper which is amazing.
I was inspired to hear such energy and commitment to this idea of having Rock Star Potential.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Now I have been talking about &lt;strong&gt;Rock Star Potential&lt;/strong&gt; throughout
blog for a reason.  If I had to sum it up in a few words I&#39;d like to think of it
as our internal drive to overcome adversity, to never give up, to aim high, and
to not be afraid to take on challenges.  It is the type of person who wants to
continually learn.  Brandon&#39;s last lesson was on his approach for getting to 
know someone you are interviewing called &lt;strong&gt;Squeeze the Tomato.&lt;/strong&gt;  
He wants to get underneath the surface of the people he interviews so he writes
down notes during the whole process.  Odd word choice, apparent rises in 
anxiety levels, or just an unclear comment, when he finds that soft spot on 
that tomato he sticks his finger in it!  I have to admit that makes me nervous 
for the next time I&#39;m being interviewed.  I asked Brandon for some advice for 
the people about to be interviewed at the end of his presentation.  He replied 
with being prepared, researching company you are applying to, being authentic, 
and ask for the transparency technique at the end.  I enjoyed attending this event and even though I&#39;m not an interviewer I learned they have a challenging job as well.  This will definitely help me become more prepared and help me relax during the interview process.  
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Power of Vim</title>
   <link href="http://a2k11.github.io/2014/10/21/the-power-of-vim/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://a2k11.github.io/2014/10/21/the-power-of-vim</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Vim and Tmux Commands&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vim is Vi Improved.  It is a text editor that is based off of vi which was a
text editor for unix based systems.  It is a free open source software which was
designed for use from a command line interface and a stand only application.  It
was first released in 1991 and has been updated 23 additional times.  For the
past 4 1/2 weeks I&#39;ve been trying to become an efficient and productive vim
user.  It is difficult to not enter &quot;INSERT&quot; mode and correct all your mistakes
by using the up and down arrows.  You have to be patient with vim in order to
learn its power and it is very powerful.  Here is a list of the common commands
I use with vim as of right now and I hope to keep adding to this arsenal over
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
VIM COMMANDS

vim (filename)         --&gt;  open filename for edits
(space) + n + t        --&gt;  new vim tab
(space) + p + (tab)    --&gt;  view next tab
(space) + n + (tab)    --&gt;  view previous tab
:!                     --&gt;  mkdir
:e                     --&gt;  newfile / mkdir
(ctrl) + p             --&gt;  search for file
:%s/oldthing/newthing  --&gt;  replace
gg                     --&gt;  go to top
(shift) + g            --&gt;  go to bottom
ciw                    --&gt;  change inside of word
.                      --&gt;  repeat change
==                     --&gt;  align line correctly
= + (shift) + g        --&gt;  align everything below
(shift) + j            --&gt;  smash two lines together
(shift) + a            --&gt;  go to end of line
e                      --&gt;  go to the end of next word
w                      --&gt;  go to the beginning of next word
:sort                  --&gt;  sort the contents
:vs                    --&gt;  split the vim window

TMUX COMMANDS

tmux -2                    --&gt;  start tmux with darker color
(ctrl + a) + (shift + 5)   --&gt;  create two terminal windows vertical
(ctrl + a) + (shift + &#39;)   --&gt;  create two terminal windows horizontal 

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I hope to add to this ever growing knowledge of commands.  It is
easier to learn by practicing editing files without ever touching your mouse.  I
like to think of it as a style of the experts which is my goal to become.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Class Relationships</title>
   <link href="http://a2k11.github.io/2014/10/13/has-many-belongs-to/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Has Many and Belongs To&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a relationship we can define between classes in ruby which makes it
very easy to communicate between objects in rails.  If we decide to have an
application which has a Gallery model and an Image model ( &lt;em&gt;Note classes are
singular, controllers are plural&lt;/em&gt; ), we can relate the two simply by using the
code below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
class Gallery &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :images
end

class Image &lt; ActiverRecord::Base
  belongs_to :gallery
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Pluralizing classes is important when using these connections with another
model.  It also helps to draw an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) to help
decide whether you need these connections.  It makes it easier to see a solution to a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I Shook Sinatra.rb's Hand</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Week 2 Learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have made it through another week.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sinatrarb.com/&quot;&gt;Sinatra&lt;/a&gt; is a DSL, domain specific
language, for creating web applications in Ruby.  It uses routes which are HTTP
methods paired with a URL matching pattern.  Each route has a block and I have
created many routes throughout the week.  It&#39;s very interesting and fun to build an
application and be able to view your work on a local server.  I find it
rewarding to finish a project in class at the end of the day.  It makes me focus
more during class and it helps me greatly later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;I should log, about this blog, go for a jog, escape the fog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really, really, really, hope to figure out this blog setup and I might start
building it from scratch.  I can&#39;t figure out how to link pages to the older and
newer tags at the bottom of the page and it&#39;s frustrating.  I also recently
joined a gym so I can start jogging and work my way up to running again.  I miss
doing cardio and I think it would relieve a lot of stress.  It definitely has
been a tough week but I figure if I made it this far I can go farther for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>SQL and Final Project Status</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;SQL and Final Project Status 9/29/14&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have a case of the Mondays.&lt;/em&gt;  I&#39;m not feeling too well, and I believe I
caught something from NYC&#39;s various subway systems.  It also means I will be
trying to get more rest for the next couple days.  I just learned some basic
Query language code which is not too complicated.  The biggest task will be to
use SQL effectively and without trouble later on.  I have a little bit of work
to do with my final project and I&#39;m not too sure I will be able to follow
through with my proposal.  It is hard to plan this far ahead considering we are
only through week 1.  Hopefully I will be able to figure out more within the
next few days.  Here are some SQL functions I have learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SELECT * FROM (table) WHERE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LIKE and ILIKE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OR, AND&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IS NULL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...FROM (table) JOIN (another table) ON (primary = foreign keys)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GROUP BY (label)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INSERT INTO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UPDATE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DELETE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dedicated to help and understanding.&lt;/em&gt;  The idea of this blog is to help me
understand the concepts I learn during the week.  Hopefully I will be able to
produce posts which provide help to others who have similar problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Providing Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My webpage is located &lt;a href=&quot;http://a2k11.github.io&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I will also be working on
this site as time goes on.  It will get better over time, I guarantee it!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;First Post 9/26/14&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&#39;m a part of this now.&lt;/em&gt;  My first week at the Ruby on Rails
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisismetis.com&quot;&gt;Metis&lt;/a&gt; has been very cool so far.  I have met a lot
of new friends and have learned a lot about the programming language Ruby.  Here
is a list of what specifically I&#39;m working on with Ruby:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passing Blocks to Methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;def method(variable, &amp;amp;block)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;block.call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yield&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symbols --&gt; :symbol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vim commands and becoming better at using it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My typing skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the methods .times, .each, and .map&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrays and Hashes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Other Thoughts / Reflection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it has been a week now and I&#39;m a little tired.  I definitely feel great about
the progress I&#39;ve made since Monday but I don&#39;t want to become content with just
being ok.  I&#39;m literally counting the nights until I move into the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://krash.io/&quot;&gt;Krash&lt;/a&gt; place I reserved through December.  Being only two
blocks away from class will be awesome and I will probably sleep better at
night.  I also will get to cook my meals again which is something I miss doing
since it helps me eat healthy foods.  My passion project at the end of this
course is still in the works.  I submitted my outline and I hope to have
feedback sooner than later.  I hope I get a chance to view some of the sites
while I&#39;m here in New York this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
